# Webpack 2 babel + sass basic setup
This repository is a good and basic starter project for any web project that uses SASS and ES6.

## What do i need to use this setup?
You need nodejs, npm and webpack-dev-server. Installing Node will also install npm, but you need to install npm globally.

1. node:                   (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. npm:                    npm install npm@latest -g
3. webpack-dev-server:     npm install webpack-dev-server -g
